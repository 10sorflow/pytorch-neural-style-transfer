## Neural Style Transfer (optimization method) :computer: + :art: = :heart:
This repo contains a concise PyTorch implementation of the original NST paper (:link: [Gatys et al.](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)).

It's an accompanying repository for [this video series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S78LQebx6jo&list=PLBoQnSflObcmbfshq9oNs41vODgXG-608).

### What is NST algorithm?
The algorithm transfers style from one input image (the style image) onto another input image (the content image) using CNN nets (usually VGG-16/19) and gives a composite, stylized image out which keeps the content from the content image but takes the style from the style image.

### Why yet another NST repo?
It's the **cleanest and most concise** NST repo that I know of + it's written in **PyTorch!** :heart:

Most of NST repos were written in TensorFlow (before it even had L-BFGS optimizer) and torch (obsolete framework, used Lua) and are overly complicated often times including multiple functionalities (video, static image, color transfer, etc.) in 1 repo and exposing 100 parameters over command-line (out of which maybe 5 or 6 may actually be used on a regular basis).

## Examples

Transfering style gives beautiful artistic results:

And here are some results coupled with their style:

*Note: all of the stylized images were produced by me (using this repo).*
*ToDo: Add credit to other people who produced content/style images.*

### Content/Style tradeoff

### Impact of total variation (tv) loss

### Starting with different init images: random, style, content

Reconstruction of same images as from the [original paper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) (Fig 3.)

### Content reconstruction

### Style reconstruction

## Setup

1. Run `conda env create` from project directory.
2. Run `activate pytorch-nst`

That's it! It should work out-of-the-box executing environment.yml file which deals with dependencies.

-----

PyTorch package will pull some version of CUDA with it, but it is highly recommended that you install system-wide CUDA beforehand, mostly because of GPU drivers. I also recommend using Miniconda installer as a way to get conda on your system. 

Follow through points 1 and 2 of [this setup](https://github.com/Petlja/PSIML/blob/master/docs/MachineSetup.md) and use the most up-to-date versions of Miniconda (Python 3.7) and CUDA/cuDNN.
(I recommend CUDA 10.1 as it is compatible with PyTorch 1.4, which is used in this repo, and newest compatible cuDNN)

## Usage

1. Copy content images to the default content image directory -> ./data/content-images/
2. Copy style iamges to the default style image directory -> ./data/style-images/
3. Run `python neural_style_transfer.py --content_img_name <content-img-name> --style_img_name <style-img-name>`

It's that easy. For more advanced usage take a look at the code it's (hopefully) self-explanatory (if you speak Python ^^).

### Debugging/Experimenting

Q: L-BFGS can't run on my computer it takes too much GPU VRAM?<br/>
A: Set Adam as your default and take a look at the code for initial style/content/tv weights you should use as a start point.

Q: Output image looks too much like style image?<br/>
A: Decrease style weight or take a look at the table of weights (in neural_style_transfer.py), which I've included, that works.

Q: There is too much noise (image is not smooth)?<br/>
A: Increase total variation (tv) weight (usually by multiples of 10, again the table is your friend here or just experiment yourself).
