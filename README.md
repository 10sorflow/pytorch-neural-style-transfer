## Neural Style Transfer (optimization method) :art::boom::gem:
This repo contains a concise PyTorch implementation of the original NST paper (:link: [Gatys et al.](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)).

It's an accompanying repository for [this video series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S78LQebx6jo&list=PLBoQnSflObcmbfshq9oNs41vODgXG-608).

The algorithm transfers style from one input image (the style image) onto another input image (the content image) and gives a composite, stylized image out which keeps the content from the content image but takes the style from the style image.

Why yet another NST repo?
It's the cleanest and most concise NST repo that I know of. 
Most of NST repos were written in TensorFlow (before it even had L-BFGS optimizer) and torch (obsolete framework, used Lua)
